%% GENERAL SIMULATION INFO
% If you are simulating the robot with Gazebo, 
% remember that you have to launch Gazebo as follow:
% 
% gazebo -slibgazebo_yarp_clock.so
% 
% and set the environmental variable YARP_ROBOT_NAME = icubGazeboSim.
% To do this, you can uncomment the 

% setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','iCubGenova01');
% setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','iCubGenova02');
% setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','iCubDarmstadt01');
setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','icubGazeboSim');
% setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','iCubGenova05');
